title: Preference Adjudication Rating Guide
---

For applicants who proceed through both assessment interviews, transmute the interview assessment ratings into a final overall passing score to determine the category where they should be placed (before preferences are applied).

**NOTE:** Applicants who do not receive a combination of 1s and 2s are not placed in a category as they did not achieve an overall passing score.

| Interview Ratings | Resulting Points | Category |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Two 1s | 70 | Qualified |
| One 1, One 2 | 85 (average of 70 and 100) | Well Qualified |
| Two 2s | 100 | Best Qualified |
