title: Template - Email to SMEs for Interview Availability
---

Phone interviews with applicants who passed the resume review phase of the `{POSITION-NAME}` will take place between `{DATE}` and `{DATE}`. We expect to use up to `{HOURS-ESTIMATE}` hours of your time each week over this period, with approximately one morning and one afternoon interview daily.

Please respond to this email by `{DATE}` to tell us:

- Which times you will block on your calendar each day throughout this period to conduct 2-3 phone interviews (60 minutes each).
- Which days you'll be unavailable for a period of time and therefore unable to interview.

After you provide us with your availability, add those time blocks to your calendar on a recurring basis so that schedulers can match you up to applicants during those time periods. In your calendar blocks, include 30-60 minutes after each interview to rate the candidate, complete your interview notes, and upload your scoring document into USA Staffing.

Thank you!
