From `{DATE}` to `{DATE}`, `{AGENCY}` is conducting two rounds of rolling, structured phone interviews for a `{GS LEVEL}` `{ROLE NAME}` role with `{NUMBER OF SMES}` subject matter experts (SMEs). You’ll first schedule applicants for Interview 1, and as SMEs submit their ratings, you can begin scheduling Interview 2 for applicants who receive a passing rating.

## Scheduling SME Interviews for the USDS Hiring Pilot

Use these dates and instructions to complete the scheduling for your hiring action.

`{APPLICANT ESTIMATE}` applicants will likely move from resume review to Interview 1. We estimate `{10% OF APPLICANT ESTIMATE}` applicants won’t respond to scheduling requests.

- **`{DATE}` – Determine SMEs’ Personal Relationships with Applicants:** Using the SME Recusal Email Template, send SMEs an email to confirm they don’t have a personal relationship with any applicants who are being interviewed. If they do have a conflict, they must respond to you by EOD `{DATE}`.
- **`{DATE}` – Receive Applicant List from HR:** HR will send you a list of applicant names, emails, phone, numbers, and the roles they’re currently being considered for.
- **`{DATE}` – Send Interview 1 Scheduling Request to Applicants:** Using the scheduling email template from USDS, as well as the list of applicants from HR, send the initial scheduling notification to applicants.
- **`{DATE}` – Begin Scheduling Interview 1 with Applicants and SMEs:** As applicants respond with their availability, use the SME availability list you received from USDS to schedule 60-minute interviews with one applicant per SME (see “SME Assignments for Interview 1” for more information). HR will have sent resumes to the SMEs by this time.
  - To schedule applicants, send an email that includes the dial-in information, the name of the SME, and the role(s) the applicant is interviewing for.
  - To schedule SMEs, send a calendar invite. Do not schedule them for more than 3 interviews per day, and do not schedule them for back-to-back interviews as they need time to complete feedback and ratings immediately after an interview.
  - Do not schedule an SME to interview an applicant if they have a personal relationship outside of work.
- **`{DATE}` – Interview 1 Begins:** SMEs begin interviewing scheduled applicants as they respond to the scheduling notification.
- **`{DATE}` – Send Reminder to Applicants:** For applicants who have not responded to the scheduling request for Interview 1, either email or call them to say they will be disqualified if they don’t respond by `{DATE}`.
- **`{DATE}` – Send Interview 2 Scheduling Request to Applicants:** Interview 2 will occur on a rolling basis as SMEs complete Interview 1 and submit their ratings. Using the scheduling email template from USDS, as well as the list of applicants from HR, send the Interview 2 scheduling notification to applicants.
- **`{DATE}` – Begin Scheduling Interview 2 with Applicants and SMEs:** As applicants respond with their availability, use the SME availability list you received from USDS to schedule 60-minute interviews with a maximum of two SMEs per applicant depending on the roles they’re being considered for (see “SME Assignments for Interview 2” for more information).
  - To schedule applicants, send an email that includes the dial-in information, the name of the SME, and the role(s) the applicant is interviewing for.
  - To schedule SMEs, send a calendar invite. Do not schedule them for more than 3 interviews per day, and do not schedule them for back-to-back interviews as they need time to complete feedback and ratings immediately after an interview.
  - Do not schedule an SME to interview an applicant they have a personal relationship with.
- **`{DATE}` – Send Reminder to Applicants:** For applicants who have not responded to the scheduling request for Interview 2, either email or call them to say they will be disqualified if they don’t respond by `{DATE}`.
- **`{DATE}` – Interview 2 Begins:** SMEs conduct Interview 2 with applicants. If necessary, this phase can be extended through `{DATE}`.
- `{DATE}` – Send Reminder to Applicants: For applicants who have not responded to the scheduling request for Interview 2, either email or call them to say they will be disqualified if they don’t respond by `{DATE}`.
