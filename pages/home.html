intro: The Subject Matter Expert Qualification Assessments (SME-QA) process introduces subject matter experts (SMEs), in partnership with HR specialists as guides, to create and conduct job related assessments before an applicant is considered qualified. While SMEs verify the presence of position-related technical competencies, HR specialists protect merit system principles and ensure the integrity of the process.
