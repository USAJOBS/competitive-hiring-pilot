<h2>Data Science</h2>

<p class="usa-intro">
  In August 2020, USDS, OPM, and the Chief Data Officer council initiated the multi-agency Data Science Hiring Action Pilot using the SME-QA process. Ten federal agencies (16 components) initially participated, followed by selections from more agencies. The CDO council published <a href="https://www.cdo.gov/news/data-scientist-hiring-pilot/">the results of the action in June 2021</a> and the cert is available for selections until Spring 2022.
