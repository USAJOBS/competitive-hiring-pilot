<h2>Final checklist before JOA Posting</h2>

<ul>
<li>If using USA Staffing, have you set up the manual assessments in order to import the SMEQA assessment results into Staffing? <b>Not doing this will cause a large amount of manual work.</b></li>
<li>Do you have a final private copy of the competencies and proficiencies that SMEs have approved with language matching the JOA?</li>
<li>Is your HR specialist in office and ready to process applicants any day the application may close?</li>
<li>Are the SMEs and HMs ready to do recruitment when you send them the link?</li>
<li>Do you have language calling out the page limit for resume review in the JOA</li>
<li>Have you included language allowing candidates to be considered for other hiring actions?</li>
<li>Have you included the opt-in questionnaire item on being considered for employment at other agencies?</li>
<li>Do you have a link to the questionnaire in your JOA?</li>
<li>Did you consider including language telling applicants the announcement will remain open for either 240 days or 365 days to maximize selections off the certificate throughout the year?</li>
<li>Is your announcement clear about the locations of each posting and if you can hire people remotely? (candidates may assume positions are remote-friendly)</li>
<li>Do you have the elements on your announcement so that you can make successful offers? For example:</li>
  <ul>
      <li>Relocation incentives</li>
      <li>Recruitment incentives/superior quals statements?</li>
      <li>Promotion potential
      <li>Position sensitivity/clearance information</li>
      <li>Relocation incentives</li>
      <li>Drug test requirements</li>
      <li>Telework eligiblity</li>
      <li>Travel requirement</li>
    </ul>
