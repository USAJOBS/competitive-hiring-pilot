intro: High applicant volume from USAJOBS often convinces agencies that they don't need to recruit for their positions. To attract highly qualified applicants who don't typically search USAJOBS, plan where you'll advertise your announcement before the job is posted using these common private sector recruitment methods.

### Use personal and professional referrals

Traditional networking is extremely effective for finding great candidates. Mention positions to your internal networks, and ask them to reach out to *their* networks to encourage people to apply.

### Post to free and popular targeted job boards

Consider finding popular job boards targeted to the audience you are trying to reach. See "[Popular Technology Job Boards](../../../toolkit/job-announcement/technology-job-boards/)" for some ideas. If you have access to paid job boards, then additionally use those resources.


### Mine resumes

The USAJOBS Agency Talent Portal allows you to search over a million resumes. To request an account, write to <a href="mailto:recruiter-help@usajobs.gov">recruiter-help@usajobs.gov</a>.

### Answer questions about your job posting via email or phone

Schedule conference calls to answer potential applicants' questions, staffed by a panel of people involved with the hiring action. While these calls don't help attract applicants, they improve the applicant experience by narrowing the pool to truly interested applicants who need specific answers to stay in contention.

To use this method, pre-schedule your informational call and include the time, phone number, and explanation of the types of questions you'll cover in your job announcement. Alternatively, include a phone number or email address that will be staffed for the duration of your posting.

For example:

> To address questions about the application process and requirements, `{YOUR OFFICE}` will offer several optional phone calls during the application period for this position. For details about the timing of those calls and how to participate, see <https://www.eventbrite.com/o/[id]>."
