Agencies using the SME-QA process can use a special, plain-language USAJOBS job announcement template created for this assessment strategy. The template pre-populates many of the JOA posting requirements, including the required Legal and Regulatory Guidance section. To create your posting, complete only these sections.

While you'll continue to use the occupational questionnaire to gather general biographical information about the applicant, you won't use the self-rated assessment portion of the questionnaire. Instead, the structured assessment interviews you've documented in your assessment strategy serve as the examination.

### 1. Title

Use a clear title that qualified applicants will recognize as encompassing their skills. If your job is open to the public, use a title common to the private sector for the same position.

### 2. Overview

To ensure your hiring process will be manageable for participating SMEs, clearly state your limit on the number of applications that will be reviewed, ideally limited to 100. Consider the options in this table for limiting applications.

| Suggested Text | Benefits | Risks |
|---|---|---|
| “The agency will consider applications from the first 100 applicants who complete their submission.” | SMEs will only need to review 100 applications. | Due to applicant volume on USAJOBS, announcement may close very shortly after it's posted, possibly after a couple of hours. Depending on when the announcement is posted, this limited timeframe may occur outside business hours in other US time zones.
| "This announcement will close at midnight on the day that 100 applications are received." | Your announcement will remain open through midnight on the day it's posted, allowing interested people to apply after regular work hours. | Your SMEs may be required to review more than 100 applications. |

### 3. Duties

Duties should be informed by the job tasks you documented during job analysis. Place the most important job duties as the first few bullets.

### 4. Qualifications

List all competencies you developed during job analysis together to describe the minimum qualifications for the position. If required for the position, you can describe specific recency requirements when skills obtained many years ago would not be relevant to the work being performed. For example, a technical position may require experience with modern cloud technologies within the last three years.

Include only the competencies SMEs developed during job analysis as the qualifications for your position. You're not required to list the OPM qualification standards in your job announcement.

### 5. Required Documents

To attract both public and private sector applicants, limit the number of pages of work history that SMEs will review on a resume based on what was decided during your job analysis workshop. From the OPM Delegated Examination Handbook (page 42):

> While the format (including length) of a résumé cannot be restricted, you may place a reasonable limit on the number of pages of a résumé that will be reviewed as part of your initial qualification determination. This limit must be clearly explained in the job opportunity announcement. You may not automatically screen-out applicants who submit résumés of longer lengths. For example, you may state in your job opportunity announcement, “Please limit your résumé to 5 pages. If more than 5 pages are submitted, only the first 5 pages will be reviewed to determine your eligibility/qualifications.

### 6. This Job Is Open To

When posting your job to the public, select only *The public*, which encompasses veterans and other groups. This section isn't a recruitment advertisement, and selecting additional options makes it unclear to applicants who is eligible to apply.

### 7. Assessment Strategy

Use the 'How You Will Be Evaluated' section to describe that applicants will be examined by subject matter experts using a structured interview process, then describe your phases. You should have established this information with SMEs during the job analysis workshop when you <a href="../job-analysis/documenting-assessment-strategy">documented your assessment strategy</a>. For example:

> The technical qualifications for this position will be evaluated by subject matter experts. Apply only if you meet the qualifications. If you are not selected for this position you may be considered for similar positions at the agency within 90 days.

> 1. Resume review
Subject matter experts will review the first three pages of your resume to determine your technical qualifications for your chosen role(s) based on the required competencies.

> 2. Qualifying phone interviews
If the subject matter experts determine that your resume reflects the required competencies, you will have at least one phone interview to further assess whether your experience meets the required competencies for your chosen role(s). You may meet with more than one subject matter expert for a determination to be made.

> 3. Ranking and preference
Preference will be applied to applicants who move forward after the qualifying phone interviews.
