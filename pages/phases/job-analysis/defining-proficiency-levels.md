intro: Once you've defined your competencies, define the proficiency levels you'll use to compare an applicant's experience against the competencies. This establishes the required experience for the position.

We recommend using the levels *Meets Qualifications* and *Exceeds Qualifications* for each competency, along with a definition of what that level looks like. The scenarios you use to define the proficiency levels should be consistent, involving these types of differences:

- **Scale of activity:** The applicant did something at a small organization _-vs-_ did something at a large organization.
- **Seniority:** The applicant did something as part of a group _-vs-_ lead the group that did something.
- **Level of detail:** The applicant can explain a general concept _-vs-_ can discuss the concept in detail.

The same set of competencies and proficiencies can be used for different grade levels because roles that require more seniority set the required proficiencies higher than junior roles.

For more information about how applicants are considered qualified in this process, see [our minimum qualifications definition](../../../about/differences/).
