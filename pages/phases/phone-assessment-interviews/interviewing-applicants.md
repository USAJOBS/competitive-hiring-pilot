intro: SMEs will conduct phone interviews for applicants who moved forward from resume review. If the applicant does not receive a high enough rating in the first phone assessment interview, they will not continue to the second phone assessment interview.

Complete and share the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/toolkit/assessment-strategy/phone-interview-template.docx/">SME Interview Rating Form</a> with SMEs to document their interview notes. At the scheduled time, the SME should call the provided number from the interview calendar invite. During the interview, the SME will type the applicant's responses to the interview questions, and should be professional if including notes about the applicant's behavior. When the interview is finished, SMEs should complete rating form and return it to HR before the end of the next business day.


If multiple SMEs are conducting the second phone assessment interview because of a role-specific depth question, they should designate one SME to ask questions, fill out the template, and email it to the HR specialist. This SME should get input from the other SME to form their assessment of the applicant's response to their role-specific depth question.
