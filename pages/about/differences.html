title: How our process is different
intro: In the current competitive hire process, agencies use HR resume review and occupational questionnaires to determine whether a candidate is “minimally qualified.” Applicants who pass this step are automatically “eligible” for quality category placement and veterans’ preference application. The OPM-USDS Pilot instead deploys a subject matter expert (SME) resume review step as a pre-qualification for an overall passing score assessment. HR adjudicates and applies veterans’ preference only to those applicants who achieve the overall passing score after the second interview. HR works with SMEs during a job analysis workshop to develop the competencies, proficiency levels, and structured interview questions that will define the assessments. If the agency has IO Psychologists available, they are encouraged to participate.

        <p>
          SMEs use their expertise and technical ability to assess whether an applicant is truly qualified before being considered minimally qualified and eligible for Veterans' Preference. When using this hiring process, HR is not required to conduct a separate minimum qualifications review. Instead, your role is to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Guide SMEs in defining the assessment criteria.</li>
          <li>Train them how to review resumes and conduct interviews.</li>
          <li>Review their resume review and interview feedback to ensure they use the pre-determined assessment criteria.</li>
          <li>Ensure SMEs provide a technical reason they decline anyone determined not to be qualified.</li>
          <li>Review pay settings for mimally qualified applicants who are current federal employees to make sure they qualify for the certificate.</li>

          <h4>Current process</h4>
          <p>
            Agencies use OPM's Qualification Standards to define the minimum qualifications for the job. Specialized Experience describes requirements needed for day one on the job. Often, agencies describe these experience requirements as overly specific job tasks.

          <h4>Pilot process</h4>
          <p>
            In the job announcement under “Qualifications,” HR lists the technical competencies that they helped SMEs to identify and define during job analysis. These technical competencies describe the specialized experience as the minimum qualifications for the position to assess applicants throughout the hiring action.

          <h4>Current process</h4>

            HR reviews resumes to determine whether applicants demonstrate the required qualifications for the posted position. Applicants who pass this review are “minimally qualified.”

        <div class="tablet:grid-col padding-y-2">
          <h4>Pilot process</h4>
          <p>
            Before sending resumes to SMEs, HR reviews all applications to remove applicants who are missing resumes and who do not meet eligibility requirements (such as citizenship and confirming the submission of a resume).  SMEs review the resumes of the remaining applicants to determine whether their technical competencies meet the proficiency requirements established during job analysis.  Instead of performing a separate minimum qualification check, HR ensures that the SMEs provide sufficient justification to retrace their decisions.

          <h4>Current process</h4>
          <p>
            Most commonly, HR assesses applicants using a self-rated occupational questionnaire. HR uses the results to confirm qualification and to determine category placement.
          </p>

        <div class="tablet:grid-col padding-y-2">
          <h4>Pilot process</h4>
          <p>
            Applicants whom SMEs move forward past resume review are assessed for technical qualifications using structured interviews. No applicant receives 70 points to be considered qualified until after the structured assessment interviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            Applicants who do not achieve a high enough rating on the first breadth interview do not need to complete the second depth interview.
          </p>
          <p>
            The interview assessment ratings are combined to create an <em>overall passing score</em> where passing requires the applicant to demonstrate that they meet the required proficiency levels. The passing score then transmutes to a minimum passing score of 70 or higher.

            For applicants who achieved an overall passing score from the structured interviews, HR adjudicates veterans’ preference and assigns applicants to a quality category based on their overall score and veterans’ preference. HR ensures that the applicants on the certificate meet GS level requirements for the position.  HR then issues the certificate to the hiring manager for further interviews or to make immediate selections off the resumes and transcripts of interviews.
