title: Lessons Learned
intro: In Spring 2019, USDS and OPM partnered to run identical hiring pilots at both Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of Interior (DOI). The pilots, named the Subject Matter Expert Qualification Assessment (SME-QA) Process, tested whether SME qualification determinations improve hiring outcomes within the competitive service.

  To begin the pilots at both agencies, USDS facilitated a job analysis workshop with HR specialists and SMEs to establish minimum qualification criteria and structured interview assessments. HR specialists used the information from the workshop to craft and post a shorter, private-sector-style job announcement. Two trained subject matter experts (SMEs) separately reviewed each applicant’s resume to determine whether they qualified for a first interview. A single SME conducted the first interview, which assessed the applicant’s breadth of knowledge in the required competencies. Those who passed the first interview received a second interview with a different SME to assess their depth of knowledge in the required competencies. Only applicants who passed the second interview were considered qualified. HR specialists then adjudicated veterans’ preference, applied category ratings, and issued certificates to selecting officials.
